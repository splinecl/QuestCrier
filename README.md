# Quest Crier
Announce quest progress in party chat.

## Info

This addon enables announcement of quest progress in the party chat.

This enables party members to easily track the progress of each others quests. 

## Slash Commands

Use `/qc` to toggle addon on/off

Use `/qc <number>` to toggle throttling

The on/off and throttling settings are all stored on a per account basis.

### Throttling
If throttling is set to X, you will only see every X progress message. You will always see the first and last messages no matter what throttling is set to.

So if throttle is set to 6 the quest "Bloodscalp Ears" would output the following.

    Bloodscalp Ear: 1/15
    Bloodscalp Ear: 6/15
    Bloodscalp Ear: 12/15
    Bloodscalp Ear: 15/15
