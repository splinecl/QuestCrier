# Quest Crier
Announce quest progress in party chat.

## Info

This addon enables announcement of quest progress in the party chat.

This enables party members to easily track the progress of each others quests. 

## Slash Commands

Use `/qc` to toggle addon on/off

Use `/qc <number>` to toggle throttling

### Throttling
If throttling is set to X, you will only see every X progress message. You will always see the last message no matter what throttling is set to.

So if throttle is set to 5 the quest "Dwarven Outiftters" would output the following.

    Tough Wolf Meat: 5/8
    Tough Wolf Meat: 8/8
